      <description>First hour-long show. Pretty excited about this milestone. First time on stage was in June 2013 at Comedy Masala. I took a break performing regularly in 2015 after honestbee was started. Kickstarted the standup comedy journey again after leaving the company. It has been an emotional rollercoaster these twelve months and part of that experience will be seeping into the set.
Startups by Day, Standup by Night. Suaku, Kiasu, Kaisee - in 2019, Isaac travelled from Singapore to London by land on buses and trains.</description>

      <description>I do product management during the day and perform standup comedy at night. I work with product managers, data scientists, designers, marketers, business development executives, and engineers to deliver the right product to the right users at the right time.
I was one of the three co-founders of honestbee. I left in 2018 to pursue my own path. In her halycon days, honestbee was in seven markets - Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong - delivering food and groceries to customers that loved her service.</description>
